# vello (machopo's fork)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream | https://github.com/linebender/vello (fetched by URL; no remote) |
| Fork | https://github.com/wusyong/vello (remote `origin`) |
| Branch | `machopo`, from upstream's `main` at `112736df24` (2026-11-10); the fork's `main` is upstream's, untouched |
| Version | 0.3.0 in `Cargo.toml` (`vello_cpu`, `vello_common`; `glifo` 0.4.0): v0.3.0's and the unreleased changes after it |
| License | Apache-2.0 OR MIT (`LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-MIT`) |
| Used by | machopo's `crates/raster` (`vello_cpu` and `glifo`: tiles and canvases drawn from machopo's display lists), by path |

## Why a fork

machopo follows upstream's main rather than its releases: the API machopo
draws with is main's (the release before it registers images another way),
main shares machopo's `skrifa`, and upstream keeps fixing what a browser
runs into. A change machopo needs is made here as a commit that can go
upstream as it is; it stays in the fork only until upstream has it, or,
when upstream won't take it, with the reason in the table below.

## Local modifications

The commits on `machopo` after upstream's, each a patch in machopo's
`patches/vello/` (`python3 scripts/ci.py patches vello` exports them;
`python3 scripts/ci.py third-party` checks that they give this branch):

| Commit | What | Upstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add README.machopo.md | This file. Always the last commit, and the only one that changes it, so that the others can go upstream as they are. | Fork only |

Changes are marked with `machopo:` comments. A change meant for upstream
keeps Vello's `rust-version` (1.89), checked with that toolchain before it
is sent; the fork itself builds with machopo's pinned toolchain. Anything
sent upstream is drafted first and reviewed before it goes out.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test -p vello_common -p vello_cpu -p glifo   # in this checkout
```

Upstream's snapshot tests (`vello_tests`) compare with images kept in Git
LFS: they need `git lfs pull` first.

and, in machopo, `cargo test -p raster` and the reftests and WPT of what
the change touches.

## Updating

1. Fetch upstream by URL (`git fetch https://github.com/linebender/vello
   main`) and rebase `machopo` onto the new upstream commit, fixing any
   conflicts. Drop the commits upstream now has; keep this file's commit
   last.
2. Update the start and version above, and the table.
3. Push `machopo` (`--force-with-lease`); first tag the old tip
   (`machopo-<date>`) so that machopo's older pins can still be fetched.
4. In machopo: `third_party.toml`'s `rev` and `upstream_rev`, then
   `python3 scripts/ci.py patches vello`, in the same change; fix what the
   new API breaks in `crates/raster`, and go through the tests above.
